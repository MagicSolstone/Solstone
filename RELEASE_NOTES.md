# Solstone 1.6.0

## One bar on every page
- The top bar is now the same everywhere: **Home, News, Help, Events, Servers**, and **⚙ Manage** for admins.
  - **Events** is the new name for *Coming up*. Old links still work.
  - **Servers** opens a list of your servers straight away. With only one server, it goes right to it.
  - **⚙ Manage** shows on every page for admins, the home page included.
  - **Fireworks** moved into the menu under your name, on the home page too. That menu also has *Sign out* on the home page.

## Live status is on the home page
- The live status page is gone. What it showed is now on the home page, under Help: who's playing, the world, the map, leaderboards, the recap and recent activity. Pick a server with its tab, or click its card under *Servers*.
- Old `/status` links (and wall screens) open the home page at the live section.
- **TV mode is gone** with the status page, and so is its tab in Announcements. *Read old logs again* moved to Manage → Servers & live info.
- The setting is now **Show the servers live on the home page** (Manage → Servers & live info), with the same choices as before: coordinates and map, items, activity, the web map.
- Banners set for the status page show on the home page, and the bedtime countdown now shows there too.

## Fixes
- **Manage:** *Notifications* no longer sits far off on its own at the end of the tabs.
- **Tabs** no longer show a small scrollbar beside them.
- **Firework editor:** clearing or starting a new firework can't trip over a missing button any more ("Cannot read properties of null").

## Who played, not how long
- **No more "Time played" leaderboard.** Nobody should be racing to play the longest. Get outside!
- **Only admins see how long anyone played.** You keep it for screen-time limits and the weekly digest. Everyone else, and the public pages, see *who* played and *which days*, never for how long:
  - The recap lists who played, in the order they joined, without hours. "Played the longest" is gone.
  - *Time played* becomes **Who played**: a square for each day each person played.
  - Players' pages show **Days played** ("12 of the last 30 days"). The "Time played" stat is gone from the stats strip and the statistics.
  - The activity timeline shows when a session started, not how long it lasted.
  - The live section says *Playing now*, never "playing for 2 h" or "3 h today".
  - The server leaves the numbers out of what it sends, so they can't be dug out of the page either.
- *Last seen* still sorts the players list.

## A fuller overview for Player accounts
- **At a glance**, above the recap:
  - **Server**: how many are playing, the version, and whether it's running smoothly.
  - **In the world**: the in-game day, time and weather.
  - **You**: your level and last seen, linking to your inventory, stats and fishing.
  - **Events**: the next three coming up.
- **Who played** over the last two weeks.
